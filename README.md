# Full-Stack Rust + React Task Manager

This project is a simple task management application built with a **Rust** backend using **Actix Web** and **SQLx** for interacting with a **PostgreSQL** database, and a **React** frontend for the user interface.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- Integrated Rust backend with PostgreSQL.
- Frontend built with React.

## Project Structure

```bash
CRUD/
├── react-frontend/   # React application for frontend
├── rust-backend/     # Rust API backend with Actix Web
└── README.md         # This readme file
```

## Technologies Used:
- Rust (backend)
- Actix Web (web framework)
- SQLx (PostgreSQL ORM)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- React (frontend)

## Prerequisites:
- Rust
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js (for React frontend)

## Future Improvements:
- Deploy the app to a public server (e.g., Caddy, Heroku, Vercel, or DigitalOcean).
